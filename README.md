## Background

3D render engines that are nowdays used in games. I write a very simple 3d render engine demo so that it will really help me understand some fundamental principles which are also used for modern render engines.

Through making this render engine, I learn about orthographic projection, simple triangle rasterization, z-buffering, flat shading and subdividing a tetrahedron to a sphere.
